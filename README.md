## Description: 

         This portfolio not only showcases my work but also attempts to bring you a glimpse into who I am as a person and a developer. One quirk that you may notice is that I have a funstioning menu with links to things that are on my one page app. This is just to show my ability to use rouer and links to move about a multi page setting as well. 

## Installation:

         This project requires no installation, just a simple link which will be provided below
